# Computation

    SELECT SUM(total_usd) AS revenue
    FROM sales.orders
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM placed_at) = @year

The computation binds only the declared `parameters`, per the recognition
policy.[^rev-policy]

Used by the [revenue metric](/metrics/revenue.md). Derived trust tier (not
stored): **machine-confirmed** — `verified` has only non-`human:` actors.
